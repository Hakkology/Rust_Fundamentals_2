This repository exists as an archive for basic functional concepts in Rust language and further studies and will be extended over time with different functionalities.
It also includes notes taken in LKD OYK Rust 101 bootcamp.

Cargo.toml file includes the package and the various libraries. To try out different headings and code samples with binaries, you may simply write:

*cargo run "file name"*

As an alternative, you may also change the auto executable in the package section and force the code to execute the file name that you request. Once the automatic package name is configured, *cargo run* will run that script.
Following headings will discuss examples and the functionality tested in this repository for archive and learning purposes:

## Concurrency
Box and Rc function samples.

## Control Flow
If and match statements to control the flow of the project.

## Enum
Enums, functions, option tools, Some functionality.

## Fibonacci
Fibonacci example with std::io as requested in Rustlang.

## Functions
Using various functions with other statements for project flow.

## Loop
for, while and loop functionalities and relevant examples.

## Main
Variables, tuples and arrays, most basic functionality.

## Ownership
Ownership explanations, using references, possible solutions to repeated patterns in Rust, dereferencing.

## Struct
Structs, ownership examples, implementations for naivedate, using dates, various methods.

## Temperature
Temperature conversion method with std:io as requested in Rustlang.

## Threads
Using threads and handles.

## Traits
Trait examples, Impl keyword, very basic implementation for Crud operations

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome.
